This project is undertaken to fulfill the final assignment for the software engineering course.

The Software Engineering Laboratory of the Bachelor's Degree Program in Informatics Engineering plans to develop a Laboratory Management System application. This application is intended to serve as a platform for laboratory management, encompassing equipment management and the scheduling of laboratory space. In the Informatics Engineering Bachelor's Degree Program, lab usage includes activities such as lectures, practical sessions, student assignments and theses, as well as incidental events. Lab users consist of professors, lab administrators, sub-lab supervisors, and students. The faculty leadership, serving as lab managers, is assisted by the lab head and sub-lab supervisors. Lab management requires data on lab usage and equipment, including the condition and quantity of the lab equipment
